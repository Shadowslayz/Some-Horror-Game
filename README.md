# 🕯️ Echoes in the Dark  

A **movement-based psychological horror game** where every step pulls you deeper into a warehouse consumed by shadows, cursed notes, and the weight of vanished workers.  

---

## 📖 Overview  
You are the newest recruit, tasked with a job no one wants: cleaning out a warehouse that eats people alive. Workers who came before you disappeared without a trace, leaving only scraps of paper that return no matter how many times they are destroyed.  

Armed with nothing but a **wirelessly powered flashlight** and a failing **generator that runs on burnables**, you must navigate pitch-black halls, feed the generator, and destroy the cursed notes — before the darkness consumes you too.

## 🎮 Gameplay Features  
- **Movement-Based Horror:** Standing still is death — the whispers, scratching, and footsteps only get louder. Keep moving.  
- **Dynamic Light System:** Your flashlight is tethered to the generator; run out of burnables, and your light dies.  
- **Environmental Puzzles:** Notes respawn daily; burn, shred, or scatter them while racing against the dark.  
- **Atmospheric Storytelling:** Discover the fate of missing workers through environmental clues and the disembodied voice of your indifferent supervisor.  
- **Permadeath Tension:** Fail to manage your light or linger too long, and you’ll become just another missing name in the report.
